# Using the given Array of numbers, output:
#
#   - the number with the lowest value in the array, 
#   - the number with the highest value in the array, 
#   - and the difference between the highest value and the lowest value.
# 
# The program should have three separate print statements:
# 
#   lowest_number
#   highest_number
#   difference
#
# NOTE: Use the provided array (don't ask the user for a value, in this task).

the_array = [12, 23, 41, 73, 19, 6]


# ~~~~~ Specs (make it do these things) ~~~~~
#
# min_max_difference.rb should output '6', '73', and '67' on separate lines
